 1. Other students
 2. Any prepared materials (besides notes)
 3. Any lessons
 4. Any solution code from any lab, whether you wrote it or Flatiron School did

### Deliverables
This code challenge can be broken down into 7 steps. It is recommended that you commit after each step:

1. Get messages by **requesting** it from **the server**
2. Create a `Message` class, and use it to **render** each of the messages in a list 
3. **Listen** for when a user tries to add a new message
4. When a user makes a message, **Render** the new message in the message list *without refreshing the page*
5. When a user makes a message, **Send** the message to the server so that it persists
6. Use `setInterval` to re-request the messages every 500 ms and re-render them in the list
7. **Refactor** your code to make it as *clean* as possible

#### Getting the messages
The domain to use for all fetch requests will be messaged in slack.
The endpoint for getting image looks like this:
```js
GET 'http://<domain>/messages'
```

```json
Example Response:
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "content": "Hello World"
  }
]
```

> If you cannot get your fetch request to work correctly, you can  use the example response above to append content to the DOM and attempt the subsequent steps


#### Sending the messages
```js
POST 'http://<domain>/messages'

Required keys in the body of the request:
{
  content: (insert message content here)
}

Required Headers
{
  'Accept': 'application/json',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
```
